[![Addon Safe](https://cdn.rawgit.com/lubien/awesome-tos/master/badges/addon-safe.svg)](https://github.com/lubien/awesome-tos#addons-badges)  [![Addon Status Unknown](https://cdn.rawgit.com/lubien/awesome-tos/master/badges/addon-unknown.svg)](https://github.com/lubien/awesome-tos#addons-badges) 

These addons have not been officially approved but are not intrusive and can almost certainly be considered safe. See [here](https://treeofsavior.com/news/?n=467) about IMC's stance on addons.

```
5. Could you let us know which add-ons are allowed and which arenâ€™t? 

We have no plans on restricting add-ons that conveniently display information which can be obtained from external communities or between users.

However, we are sternly against add-ons that allow abnormal gameplay such as being able to use NPC stores on a field or an auto-play program. Those are prohibited and its user is liable to be banned.
